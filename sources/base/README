Using Yocto to build Linux
==========================

Required Packages for the build host
------------------------------------

The list of packages you need on the host development system can be large when covering all build scenarios using the Yocto Project. This section describes required packages according to Linux distribution and function.
Here are the required packages by function given a supported Ubuntu or Debian Linux distribution:
If your build system has the oss4-dev package installed, you might experience QEMU build failures due to the package installing its own custom /usr/include/linux/soundcard.h on the Debian system. If you run into this situation, try either of these solutions:

sudo apt build-dep qemu
sudo apt remove oss4-dev
 
sudo apt install gawk wget git diffstat unzip texinfo gcc build-essential chrpath socat cpio python3 python3-pip python3-pexpect xz-utils debianutils iputils-ping python3-git python3-jinja2 libegl1-mesa libsdl1.2-dev pylint3 xterm python3-subunit mesa-common-dev zstd liblz4-tool
sudo apt-get install u-boot-tools
sudo apt-get install apt-transport-https ca-certificates
sudo update-ca-certificates


Download influx sources
-----------------------

In your home directory download influx-linux-build sources from github

git clone https://github.com/InfluxTechnology/influx-linux-build.git -b main



Initialize build
----------------

Before starting the build, it must be initialized. In this step the build directory and local configuration files are created. 

DISTRO=fsl-imx-wayland MACHINE=imx8mmea-ucom source influx-environment-setup -b build-dir

where DISTRO is supported distro MACHINE is machine configuration for Influx technology iMX8M based chip and build-dir is your build directory


Restart a build
---------------

If you need to restart a build in a new terminal window or after a restart of the host computer you donâ€™t need to run the influx-environment-setup script again. Instead, you run the setup-environment script

source setup-environment build-dir


Starting the build
------------------

Everything has now been setup to start the actual build. Please note that depending on the capabilities of your host computer building an image can take many hours.

bitbake ea-image-base

When the build has finished the images will be available in this directory
~/ influx-linux/ build-dir/tmp/deploy/images/imx8mmea-ucom/


Deploying the image
-------------------

The development board must be set in OTG boot mode for it to work  Go to one level up in directory tree in ~/ influx-linux and start this script

./deploy-image.sh build-dir

We are using uuu (Universal Update Utility) tool to write images to the board. It is located in 
~/ influx-linux/uuu-deploy/ directory. The script upper, will copy needed files from 
~/ influx-linux/ build-dir/tmp/deploy/images/imx8mmea-ucom/ to 
~/ influx-linux/uuu-deploy/files and will start the deploying.
